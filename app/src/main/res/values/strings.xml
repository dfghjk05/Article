    <string name="text1">Jetpack Compose tutorial</string>
    <string name="text2">Jetpack Compose is a modern toolkit for building native Android Ul. Compose simplifies and accelerates Ul development on Android with less
code, powerful tools, and intuitive Kotlin APls.</string>
    <string name="text3">In this tutorial, you build a simple Ul component with declarative functions. You call Compose functions to say what elements you want and the Compose compiler does the rest. Compose is built around Composable functions. These functions let you define your apps Ul programmatically because they let you describe how it should look and provide data dependencies, rather than focus on the process of the Uls construction, such as initializing an element and then attaching it to a parent. To create a Composable function, you add the
@Composable annotation to the function name.</string>
